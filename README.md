# Annotation file for the LQ-9 phase0 genome of _Artemisia annua_
This Artemisia annua annotation file is based on manually corrected genome annotation on the 2022 version of the chromosome-level genome (LQ-9 phase0, access by http://www.gpgenome.com/species/92).
The goal of this project is to enhance the utilization of the _Artemisia annua_ genome. We will collect and organize information on issues such as error correction and gene structure variation within the genome. The resulting annotation file will be formatted according to the general feature format. We welcome submissions of any newly discovered issues via our issue tracker or pull request, and look forward to collaborating with the wider scientific community to improve our understanding of this important species.

# Why LQ90 ?
Of the genomes of _Artemisia annua_ that have been published thus far, the LQ-9 phase0 genome(LQ90) currently boasts the highest assembly quality. Given the significance of this plant in the production of artemisinin, an important anti-malarial drug, we believe that leveraging the high-quality LQ90 genome can greatly enhance research efforts in this field. By utilizing this genome as a reference, researchers can more accurately identify genes and genetic variations that may contribute to artemisinin production, and develop new strategies for enhancing its yield. In short, we believe that making reasonable use of the LQ90 genome holds great potential for advancing the field of artemisinin research, and we look forward to collaborating with others in this endeavor.
# What are the differences in this genome annotation file?
The genome was annotated using the Eukaryotic Pipeline of EuGene prior to its release. However, during our work, we discovered some issues that were difficult to avoid. We have since corrected these issues using published transcriptome data, and hope that our efforts will be helpful to others.
# Is this annotation considered to be perfect?
NO! While we have corrected many of the errors, it is difficult to avoid all of them. Genome annotation is an ongoing process and is continually refined as research progresses. We welcome your contribution in this effort to further improve the annotation of the Artemisia annua genome.
# How to use it?
This genome annotation file follows the GFF file format specification and can be downloaded and used directly.
